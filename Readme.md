Projects description:

    •	Anonymous income comparison:  A Console App example utilising comparison operators.
    •	ArrayList_assignmentg: A Console App example utilising IF/ELSE and comparison operators.
    •	Assignment_Optical_Argument_method: A Console App example utilising ‘random number generator’ method, a method with optional parameter.
    •	Assignement_overload_operator: A Console App example utilising ‘overload operators’ in a class.
    •	Assignment: An example of creating css/java and c# to create a simple web page with a button which triggers a text creation and a video to run
    •	Assignment1_methodANDobject: An example of using methods and instantiating objects
    •	Assignment_ASPCore: An example of creating an ASP.Core app. The webpage displays the current time.
    •	Assignment_CodeFirstExample: An example of creating a database using code first model.
    •	Assignment_Cons_Chainconstructors: An example of chained constructors. It’s about calling a constructor from another constructor, using ‘this’ keyword. This is when you want your object to be instantiated 
        with varying number of input parameters. So depends how many parameters you are calling your object with, different constructors are use. 
    •	Assignment_ExceptionHandling: An example of try/catch in a while loop which allows the user to try again if an exception is thrown.
    •	Assignment_Overloading_method: An example of overloading methods where multiple methods are called the same but the parameters are Of different type.
    •	Assignment_dateTime: A Console App example utilising DateTime function
    •	Assignment_lambda: An example of Console application utilising lambda expression to add names to a list of objects.
    •	Assignment_maths_methods: A Console App example utilising mathematical operators made into methods.
    •	Assignment_struct: An example of utilising struct. Struct is the value type data type that represents data structures. So as oppose to classes where a class is a reference type meaning once the class is 
        created the reference of the class is passed around rather than the object, a  struct is a value type meaning once the object is instantiated, a copy of the object is passed around rather than the                 reference to it. This ultimately means if you change the value of the property/data member, a new copy of that object will get created.
    •	Assignment_void_method: A Console App example utilising void to return nothing.
    •	CarInsurance: An example of MVC architectural paradigm. Views, model and controllers are created for insuree. An admin page was created to display all the record in the database Entity framework. The              Admin view page was copied from the Details view page as they both Get/retrieve data from the database. It’s then called in the controller page.  
    •	Console_App_tryCatch_Assignment: A Console App example utilising try/catch/finally(default). 
    •	Console_App_Assignment: A multi-faceted project covering the following concepts:
            o	Assignment part 1 - Create a string array
            o	Assignment part 2 - Create an Infinite loop
            o	Assignment part 3 - Iteration using comparison
            o	Assignment part 4 - String list
            o	Assignment part 5 - String list with duplication
            o	Assignment part 6 - Concatenate string
    
    •	DoWhile assignment: A Console App utilising a while loop Boolean comparison and switch to select cases.
    •	Enum_exampleProject: A Console App example utilising an enum object and parse method: Enum.Parse(typeof(x)).
    •	Examples: A Console App utilising do/while.
    •	MVC_Tutorial. A simple example of creating an MVC model application. 
    •	NewsLetterAppMVC: A comprehensive example of MVC model application, with various views, controllers and models utilising ADO.NET and Entity framework utilisation. 
    •	Shipping quote for package: A Console App example utilising If/Else statements. 
    •	Student of The Tech Academy: A Console App defining various datatype.
    •	TechAcadStudentMVC: A comprehensive example of MVC model application, with various views, controllers, and models.
    •	Visual_Studio_Assignmentt: An example of creating css/java and c# to create a simple web
    •	WelcomePage: A simple example of using visual studio.
    •	Approval for car insurance: A Console App example utilising comparison logics.
    •	blackjack_game: A comprehensive example of C# programming using Console App, developing a game of blackjack and defining various aspects and concept of object oriented programming.
